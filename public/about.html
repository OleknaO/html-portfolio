<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Olena is a 30-year-old fashionista who lives in the heart of Texas. She's known
  for her quirky sense of humor and her love of all things sparkly. In fact, she
  once showed up to a fancy gala wearing a glitter-covered potato sack, just for
  fun. 
</p>
<p>When Olena isn't busy scouring the city's vintage shops for unique
  accessories, she's likely at home practicing her accordion skills. She's not
  very good yet, but she likes to serenade her cat with classic Ukrainian folk
  songs anyway. Despite her eccentricities, Olena is loved by all who know her.
  She's always up for a good laugh and never takes herself too seriously.</p>
<p>
  Olena also has a bit of a sweet tooth, and her favorite food is
  chocolate-covered pickles. She swears they're delicious, but most people are
  too scared to try them.
